# harrywinser.com
My personal website. Rebuilt, and now open source!

This was originally hosted on visualstudio.com, but decided it was time to move it and reboot it.  The front end on the current harrywinser.com is pretty ugly, and this project aims to improve it.

I also hope to ensure that everything written here is configurable, so that anyone can take the code, and  with little modification use the same template for a backend; so same api etc. You could remove the frontend entirely / replace it with your own!

Technical writing will no longer be hosted on this site, but instead on tech.harrywinser.com. That is still available on git hub, but I won't be planning to make that generic.

## Technology Stack
- SpringBoot as Server framework
- Mustache as the templating engine
- Knockout.js as the frontend framework.
- Relational database to store the content. (I'll post the schema, which will can be found under SQL folder)

## Plan
- Recreation of the current site (harrywinser.com), but with a new front end
- More consistent and understandable API, with docs (which will be found at tech.harrywinser.com)
- MOAR BLOG CONTENT!
