So with renewed vigour, here I am again; filling your screen with semi coherent ramblings.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nActually, I should probably go into why I've not written in a while. Simply, I put myself under too much pressure with writing. I want to be the best (like no one ever was), but I really got to walk before I can run, and remember I do this for fun. So, I'm back again to just write and have fun. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nGuess I should talk about what I've been up to these last two months. First off, working real hard! Did a work <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23RightmoveHackathon&src=typd\" class=\"content-link\">hackathon<\/a> which was awesome. Oh and coming up with crazy new ideas and concepts. Speaking of which, if you check out my <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Hazz223\" class=\"content-link\">GitHub<\/a> you'll find like 4 partially finished projects involving Twitter Streams. I plan to do a write up of that stuff soon enough, so stay tuned (Sneak peek; Python can go suck it!) \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've also been playing around with <a href=\"https:\/\/nodejs.org\/\" class=\"content-link\" >node.js<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/knockoutjs.com\/\" class=\"content-link\" >Knockout js<\/a>. Both have been a whole lot of fun, and I plan to try and convert this website over to it. Should give me more freedom than what PHP currently offers. I also really need to put my PHP framework up on Git hub, and let others have fun with it. Need to try and extract it out first, and create some documentation.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpeaking of my website, it could do with a few tweaks and fixes. First, the crazy SSH issue which comes from my self-signed certificate. Yeah, you'll spot that if you check your console. Ha! Yeah, I'll fix that when I convert to Node. I'll also try and make it easier to view Photos and other bits and pieces, as well as optimise for Mobile. Currently it looks a little shit. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nYa'll know I love Movies and Games. I've not only been buried deep code these last few months. Recently bought a copy of Red Dead Redemption, as well as Fallout 3. Both are excellent. I'll probably do some form of Retro Roundup soon enough. Also got to see Jurassic World recently, and thoroughly enjoyed it! Will get around to writing some form of write up before that disappears from the cinema.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it comes to the random blogs like the \"What is code\"\u00c2\u009d etc. I've got another piece already in the works about the internet. So watch out for that one!\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now looking back on all I've just written, I've just realised that I've got a lot to do over the coming weeks\"\u00c2\u00a6 But let's be honest, I'd be bored if I didn't! \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, and they just added AC\/DC to Spotify\"...\r\n<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"post-image-container-tall\" style=\"width: 310px; height: 390px\">\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A52UWtKlYjZO3dHoRlWuz9S\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"><\/iframe>\r\n<\/div>\r\n",

      "data": "<p>\r\nYep. You read that correctly; I'm going to discuss online dating. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAh dating. The age old ritual that was first invented in 1769 by Richard Von Date, who created the concept to win a girls heart. Back then tea, biscuits, and pistols at dawn were used. Ah, simpler times. Anyway, enough history. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe invention of the internet has brought about many changes; an open forum for the world to share it's <a class=\"content-link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2015\/02\/05\/twitter-ceo-trolls\/\">thoughts<\/a>, a place where people can get <a class=\"content-link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.theonion.com\/\">news<\/a>, and watch <a class=\"content-link\" href=\" https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BitTorrent\">media instantly<\/a> . So of course meeting and courting people would eventually shift into this virtual, instant realm. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeing an awkward software engineer (fucking nailing the stereotype there), I have little to no luck in the bar scene. Nope, that's jock territory. And as it turns out the library isn't the best place to pick up chicks (who knew?), so I decided to take the plunge into a rather known dating site called Ok!Cupid. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h2><small>What happens online... Is documented forever and you can do nothing about it.<\/small><\/h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen you first sign up, you're assaulted with questions about yourself. I'm not particularly <a class=\"content-link\" href=\"http:\/\/www.harrywinser.com\/\">narcissistic<\/a>, and filling out several lines on a self-summary is rather daunting. This is made worse by the sudden realisation that everything about yourself can be summed up in about 300 words, or roughly the length of a standard Tesco shopping receipt. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nNext, onto the photos. I first thought this would be super simple but, turns out that past me thought it would be funny to always pull a stupid face (prick). So I'm left with a couple of half decent ones, and <del>blind naive hope<\/del> a prayer that my \"funny\" and \"witty\" 300 words wins the affection of some passing lady. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo, with some trepidation I started messaging people, and started conversations with people from all over the country. Ok!Cupid has the great feature that gives you compatibility score based on the questions you've answered, and for the logical nerd within this was a total plus. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo, how was my experience? Actually, not the nose diving plane I thought it would be.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've made friends, gone on dates, had some awkward conversations, had some weird messages, and pretty much everything else you'd expect from an online dating experience. \r\nActually, this links in with the title. Once a message has been sent, that's it. There's no hoping the other person didn't hear, or they might laugh it off as a joke. Text is a cruel bitch, and one that doesn't convey tone particularly well. <\/irony>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h2><small>\"Like a kid in the candy store where the candy is flying off the shelves. At your face.\"<\/small><\/h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I signed up, a friend of mine also did. They had a very different experience. Why? Because they are female. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=\"post-image-container-square\">\r\n<img class=\"post-image\" title=\"http:\/\/hotdogcat.com\/hotdogcat.jpg\" alt=\"sausage factory cat\" src=\"http:\/\/hotdogcat.com\/hotdogcat.jpg\">\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nBasically, she's inundated with messages from guys. A mix of genuine nice messages, such as \"hey, how's it going. <stuff about her profile>\" and messages like \"Sup babes, sex?\". I've read one from a friend where the guy described how their first date would lead to his bed, do the deed, and then they'd cuddle. Definitely not the opening Von Date had in mind for his invention. All jokes aside, how can anyone think that's a valid opening to any conversion, let alone a pick up line?\r\n<\/p>\r\nOn a whole, girls and guys have very different experiences. \r\n\r\n<h2><small>So, should I just die alone then? <\/small><\/h2>\r\n<p>\r\nDo not despair reader (especially if you're a girl; it's like a German butchers who care very little for their stock in there) for there is still hope.\r\nLike I said, I've made some great friends online. Plus, I've met a lot of people who have gotten together online, and are now in like super committed relationships and stuff. So it does happen.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, if you want to just cut out the human aspect of the whole process there is always <a class=\"content-link\" href=\"https:\/\/invisiblegirlfriend.com\/\">this<\/a> (or <a class=\"content-link\"  href=\"https:\/\/invisibleboyfriend.com\/\">this<\/a>).\r\n<\/p>",
